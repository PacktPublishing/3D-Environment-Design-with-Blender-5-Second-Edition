Creating photorealistic 3D scenes in Blender can be tricky sometimes due to modeling inaccuracies, scale issues, flat materials, and lighting that fails to match real-world references. These problems can make scenes look artificial and inconsistent.
Based on Blender 5, this updated second edition simplifies the complexities by guiding you through clear, practical workflows to overcome those challenges. You’ll start by addressing common modeling and proportion mistakes, then move on to realistic texturing and unwrapping to create stunning scenes based on actual references.
As you progress, you’ll create natural assets such as plants, rocks, water, flowers, and terrain, learning how to assemble them into believable environments. The book introduces modern Blender workflows, including a dedicated chapter on node-based methods for creating and scattering plants. You will then focus on lighting and rendering, using Cycles, HDRIs, and accurate color management to achieve realistic results, before finalizing your scenes with rendering and compositing.
By the end, you’ll be equipped to create beautiful, photorealistic renders that stand out.
